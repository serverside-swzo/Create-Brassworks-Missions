# Create: Brassworks Missions

**Create: Brassworks Missions** is an addon for [Create: Numismatics](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-numismatics) that introduces a fully data-driven missions system for **Minecraft 1.21.1**.  
Originally made for the [**Brassworks SMP**](https://modrinth.com/modpack/brassworks-smp-modpack), but available for anyone to use.

## Features
- Track missions directly on your HUD.  
- Clean, Create-style UI.  
- Open the missions menu with the default keybind **H**.  
- Administrator commands to manage player missions.  
- 24 unique mission types (with more planned).  
- Fully data-driven â€“ add your own missions via datapacks.
